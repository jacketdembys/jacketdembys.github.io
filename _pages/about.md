My name is **Uriel Jacket Trésor Demby's**. I publish my research under the name  **Jacket Demby's**. 

Currently, I am a Display Electrical Engineer at Apple where I work on Pixel Uniformity Compensation. I graduated with a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Master in Computer Engineering from the [**University of Missouri-Columbia**](https://engineering.missouri.edu) where I had the privilege of working under [**Dr. Guilherme DeSouza**](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/guilherme-desouza/) at the  [**Vision-Guided and Intelligent Robotics Laboratory (ViGIR-Lab)**](http://vigir.missouri.edu/). 

My doctoral research centers on **robotic manipulation** and **navigation**. However, my broader research interests are related to:
- **image processing**, 
- **computer vision**,
- **deep learning**, 
- **robotics**, 
- **assistive technologies**.

I welcome collaborations with **PhD students**, **faculty members**, and **researchers**. If our interests align, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

For more details on my academic background, professional experience, and skill set, please refer to my **CV** (available under the Curriculum Vitae tab above).
